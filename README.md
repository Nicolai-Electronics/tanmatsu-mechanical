# Tanmatsu mechanical design files

This repository contains the design files for the 3D printed mechanical parts for the Tanmatsu.

These consist of the following: 
  * Case
  * Spacer 
  * Speaker adapter 

All parts are integrated in the FreeCAD design file. Also a separate
STEP file each part, so people can print these directly from this
repository. 

Currently the Speaker adapter is still based on OpenSCAD design.
